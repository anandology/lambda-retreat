        What are the fundamental building blocks of computing? How to understand the computing processes from the first principles? What are the tools and techniques to build complex software and reason about their behavior?

        <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and interpretation of computer programs (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman</a>, famously known as the wizard book, is a very influential textbook with many insights into the nature of computation. Starting with building abstractions with functions and data, it goes all the way to creating programming languages with different execution models and compiling them to register machines .
        </p>

        <p>
        The Lambda Retreat is a week long retreat away from the city, with intense discussions with a small group of people, to study this great work. This immersive workshop not only covers most of the topics from the book, but also includes interesting diversions throughout.
        </p>

        <p>
        To make best use of the time at the retreat, a two week online sessions are planned before the retreat to get started and pick up a good pace, covering the initial topics of the book.

        Are you up for the challenge?

        <blockquote>
          <q>This is one of the great classics of computer science. I bought my first copy 15 years ago, and I still don’t feel I have learned everything the book has to teach.</q>
          <p>&mdash; <a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> (from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R3G05B1TQ5XGZP/?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0262510871&camp=1789&channel=detail-glance&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&nodeID=283155&store=books">his review on amazon.com, two decades ago</a>)</p>

        <blockquote>
          <q>…if you’re like me, you’re not looking for one more trick, rather you’re looking for a way of synthesizing what you already know, and building a rich framework onto which you can add new learning over a career. That’s what SICP has done for me. I read a draft version of the book around 1982, when I was in grad school, and it changed the way I think about my profession. If you’re a thoughtful computer scientist (or want to be one), it will change your life too.</q>

          <q>Reading SICP will enlighten you as a programmer, and make you a better one. I can’t imagine one programmer who won’t gain something important by reading SICP.</q>
